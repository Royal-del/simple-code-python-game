Word Rescue
The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

Concepts Learned:

Lists (to store words and guessed letters)
Loops (to keep the game running)
String manipulation (displaying correct and incorrect guesses)
Best Way to Get Started:

Start with a predefined word and display underscores for missing letters.
Add a loop for multiple guesses and reveal correct letters.
Implement a system to track incorrect guesses and limit attempts.
Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

Not handling duplicate guesses (players guessing the same letter twice).
Not checking if the player has already won (end the game once all letters are guessed).
